        #### Description of the issue

        I was installing on X hardware ...

        Then X Y Z happened and archinstoo crashed ...

        #### Virtual machine config:

        ```xml
        <domain type="kvm">
          <name>my-arch-machine</name>
          ...
          </devices>
        </domain>
        ```

        ```console
        /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -name guest=my-arch-machine,debug-threads=on -object ...
        ```

        **Note**: Feel free to modify the textarea above as you wish.
        But it will grately help us in testing if we can generate the specific qemu command line,
        for instance via:
        `sudo virsh domxml-to-native qemu-argv --domain my-arch-machine`
