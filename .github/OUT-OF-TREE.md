# AUR support

For some hardware using the AUR for drivers is inevitable

Hence why you can now use `--advanced` to get AUR support built-in using `grimaur`

=> Make sure to toggle kernel headers from your desired variant(s)

See [Out-of-Tree](./.github/OUT-OF-TREE.md) for an example install with unsupported hardware.
