# Headless options

Servers choices allow for flexible control over what you want to do.

In this example we'll set up a `tailscale` host to not have to do any port forwarding for Minecraft.

0. In server options select `tailscale` and `java`

> You can also select a firewall for the host in `Applications`

1. Get the server.jar file, agree to eula.txt in `/srv/minecraft/`

> Used the AUR version (`minecraft-server`)

2. Add your devices or friends to `tailscale`

Launch the server and enjoy playing with your friends.
