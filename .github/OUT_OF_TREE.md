# AUR support

For some hardware using the AUR for drivers is inevitable

Hence why you can now use `--advanced` to get AUR support built-in using `grimaur`

=> Make sure **to toggle kernel headers** from your desired variant(s) if youa re building DKMS modules.

*For obvious reason another disclaimer here* is to make sure you know to trust what you are installing.
Especially with the automated nature of the installs and that sufficiently harden a machine for your use cases and limit AUR usage.
